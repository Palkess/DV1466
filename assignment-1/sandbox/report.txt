6b ls -aR other/none/america/* | wc -w
6c I looked at the examples and read the manual for ls.
7a 24
7b ls -R other/none/elsewhere/* | wc -w
7c Excluded the -a flag from previous task.
8a other/none
8b du -sb other/* | sort -nr | head -n1
8c I took a look at the examples and the the manual for each
8c command. I got the command 'head' from some searches online
8c to get the first entry in the output.
9a 2
9b find other/* -type f -exec file \{\} \; | grep 'ASCII' | wc -l
9c I split up each part of the call and solved them one-by-one which
9c eventually could be combined into one command.
10a 25
10b find -mindepth 5 -maxdepth 5 -type f | wc -l
10c I did task eleven before this so I took the same command and added
10c a counter instead of limiting the output with head.
11a other/none/elsewhere/20kb/vic20
11b find -mindepth 5 -maxdepth 5 -type f | head -n1
11c Read the manual and tested the different max/mindepths.
12a 10
12b find other/none/america/* -type f | wc -l
12c Read the manual-page of find and adjusted.
13a other/redwhiteblue/uk
13b find other/* -type f | xargs ls -ltr | head -n1
13c Read up about xargs and tested it first with a simple ls. Read
13c the manual about ls to get what flags I needed to sort on time.
14a 1541
14b du -bc other/none/america/deadpresidents/* | sort -nr | head -n1
14c I knew I had to use 'du' in some way so I started with that. Then
14c I needed to find out how to count all the sizes together which I got
14c from a source online, with the '-c' flag. The rest was fairly easy,
14c I did similar sortings in previous tasks.
